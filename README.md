# PacMen-Exercise

Exercise to learn how to dynamically inject content into a web page using JavaScript.

This project is a demo website that showcases a JavaScript game. The website includes a navbar with links to other pages, buttons to add PacMan, start, and stop the game, and a description of the game. The game itself is displayed in a container on the page, and uses HTML and CSS for the visual elements. The JavaScript component of the project interacts with the HTML elements to create a dynamic game experience where the position of the elements on the screen updates in real-time .
